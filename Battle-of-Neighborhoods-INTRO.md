## Introduction
***
We are trying to open a new Korean Restaurant in Midwest. However, Midwest cities are not as populated as coast cities.<br>
Therefore, we consider only five cities. St. Paul, Chicago, Indianapolis, Detroit, and Columbus.<br>

Another factor we want to consider is competition. We don't want to open new restaurant where many Korean restaurants are located.<br>

We want to find a city where Korean restarants are spread out ranther than concentrated.<br>
We want to fidn a city with high Asain population. <br>
We want to fidn a city with small number of Korean restaurants <br>
In short, we want to find a city with lowest competition. 
## Data
***
I will use FourSqaure API to get the locations and Numbers of Korean restaurants in each cities. And I also use the Asian population information and areas from https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities for each cities.
